Our project idea revolves around an assessment of the landscape of current animation tools. We would like to assess practice as well as analyze the affordances of different categories of tools. Our primary interest is in identifying opportunity spaces. We intend to construct a design space to map out the types of production enabled by existing tools and audiences that engage with them. Some categories of tools weâ€™ve identified are as follows: 2D animation tools, virtual reality animation tools, direct manipulation tools, professional animation tools, game engines, in-house production animation technology. 

For our theoretical framework, we would like to suggest using the 12 fundamental principles of animation(squash and stretch, anticipation, staging, straight ahead action and pose to pose, follow through and overlapping action, slow in and slow out, arc, secondary action, timing, exaggeration, solid drawing, and appeal) derived from pen and paper practice as well as notions surrounding creative practice (flow, reflection in action, interfaces as creative learning environments, constructivism, collaboration, risk, tinkerability, and interface affordances).
