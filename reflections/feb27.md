In the wild evaluation allows for researchers to truly understand how their work will perform in the "outside world." With an example like the LilyPad they were able to see most of the people who are buying this product and what they created with it. I think what's interesting is that they had to put the work out there and just see what happened versus conducting a study where people would have to come in and they could explain how to use this system. In the wild seems to allow for people to create on their own and truly document their creative works without knowing they are being part of a study. The limitations of this are relying on a broad range of outsiders to find your work and then finding published results from it. The lilypad for example could have been purchased by a specific professor who taught a bunch of females in her class and each woman built and published a project using it. There would be a lot of relying on making sure the product you have is being exposed everywhere and not just within a certain group, which could easily sway results. I think one of the reasons in-the-wild evaluation is rare in HCI research overall is because I believe a lot of HCI research can discuss general ideas, but possibly not a specific project. It seems also that with the LilyPad results they needed to find people who have published work using it, but this might take too long because of time restrictions of a project.
