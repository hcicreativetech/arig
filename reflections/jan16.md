# January 16 - Reading Reflection

I think Papert was very on point when explaining how students who are given a bunch of equations, which might comprise of what seems like random charachters or numbers, might be immiditely turned off by the idea of physics. This initial introduction to physics makes it seems as if they have had no experience with the idea of physics before because they are not able to create that initial connection with anything else in their brain. They aren't able to identify how these random letters comprise of many interactions they have in their daily lives. It's important to look at how we initially engage with ideas and how if there ever is something you percieved as never  being able to accomplish, then maybe it would be interesting trying to gain a different perspective towards that task. That feeling when first interacting with a new idea, relating it back to something personal in your life, and then learning just one simple concept of that idea can be extremely rewarding and valuable. The example of understanding that Turtles change velocity lets the student imagine or visualize this idea to give more meaning to how this equation could become more meaningful. I thought this idea relates well back with this idea of Flow. For someone to achieve flow one needs to be engaged and excited about the goal they are trying to accomplish and using this idea of the Turtle allows the first step to happen.
