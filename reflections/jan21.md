# Jan 21st - Reading Reflection

My favorite medium that I have used is programming. When I was initially introduced to programming, the focus was primarily learning how storage in a computer works and writing programs were you are writing or manipulating the storage. This was something I had a really hard time visualizing, which dettered me from programing. When I was introduced to other programming softwares such as Processing, I immidietly could understand why I really loved working in this medium. Programming allows an abstract way to visualize ideas that possibly people were unable to visualize before. My focus on data visualization has allowed me to take these abstract data sets and illustrate the meaning behind them. The creative freedom that programming aloows seems impossible to get from other mediums. Programming allows this sense of ultimate freedom in creativity in how I could visualize data. Mediums like sculpture and painting become limited by physical constraints which Processing can ignore and expand past.
