# Feb 13th - Reflection

Both of these readings reminded me of an experience I had working at a startup that created an online system for maintenance management. At first, I would do assignments and only confirm with myself and with my teammates if I was doing the work correctly. I was only thinking about how I or my teammates would interact with the program not the people who were actually using the service, which were maintenance workers. I have never done maintenance management work, so although I thought I was doing a successful job, I was not empathizing with the people actually using our system. Although I was working on a product for others, I was designing for myself. One specific example I remember is testing one of my designs repeatedly and then being able to push my work to the live product. The next day, we started getting many complaints because many of the users our using a PC and chrome, which created an effect from users being able to access their typical functions. My team and I were all using MAC's though and did not predict the changes that could have happened on different devices. This was an important realization for me because it reminded me of the true focus is the user and I should be working in an environment that more resembles how a user would use the tools.
