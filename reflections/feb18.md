# Feb 18 - Reflection

Removing the ideas of novice and expert allow a connection between everyone where although they might be trying to accomplish a similar task, everyone can learn something from one another. I keep debating in my mind when these terms would be valuable and when they wouldn’t be useful. I think the ideas brought up in the second reading discussing teaching seems like a great idea to remove these words. Each person has different experiences and it’s hard to quantify weather or not someone will be better at it than another. If one were asked to create a project, I could it being valuable to have both the terms in play. A novice could come up with new or interesting ideas that an expert might not be able to come up with. The expert though could implement the novices ideas. I struggle with this idea though because I could also see the situation where an expert immediately turns down ideas because they know too much and can only think about it in one direction. A novice though might have interesting ideas, but not the skills to implement.
