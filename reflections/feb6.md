# Feb 6th - Reflection

I found this piece on tinkerability very compelling. I never had a word for it, but I definitely right away understood the argument Resnick and Rosenbaum were making. I realized currently in my thesis exploration I am actively tinkering. I have a general idea of what I would like to accomplish, but no exact plans of how I will get there. I am continually exploring and trying new ideas and actively coding to gather all the information I need to create the most informative piece. I find myself slowly creating questions throughout the process and I wonder if I had a set plan would I have thought of these other questions that have come up overtime? I find myself applying tinkering less in smaller projects such as a final project for a class. When time is limited, tinkerability becomes much more restricted because there is not much time to explore. In this case, I could imagine creating a plan to finish a project would be much more efficient and valuable to the end goal. The more I think of this idea of tinkerability, it seems that it would mostly apply in large scale research versus a corporate setting where timelines seem possibly more pressured.
