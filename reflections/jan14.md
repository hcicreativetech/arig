# January 14th - Reflection

I really enjoyed the idea of having this flow of how to make an experience more enjoyable. Many times I have heard in discussion that socialism would be the "ideal" form of government because everyone would be equal, but while reading Csikszentmihalyi's chapter I thought about how if we were to live in a socialist environment then we would have very negative world. Without having goals for new experiences and trying to strive to work hard in order to achieve those goals, we would have a very boring and minimalist society. Socialism would never allow anyone to believe if they tried to work harder they would get something more out of it. I also thought about this chapter in the context of our discussion last class on creativity. We discussed the idea of being able to have interesting thoughts and ideas, but possibly creativity means being able to put those ideas into action. Without this personality of wanting "flow" within our life styles, then nobody would ever want or even think of actually creating their interesting ideas. Today, it especially seems like everyone is trying to come up with the new best app or product, which will be universal and necessary to anyone. It would be interesting to analyze the most successful people of today and see what where the characteristics of their family in which that must have promoted them these "optimal experiences."
